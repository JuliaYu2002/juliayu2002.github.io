# Projects, I guess?

I took Data Structures last year, and my final project was called [PokeStats](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/PokeStats).

[Hackcation 2020 Project](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/TheGoodVibes)

[Google CSSI Final Project](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/cssiFinal)

[Code from my dual enrollment at CUNY Hunter College](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/HunterDE)

I'm currently trying to work on learning PyGame and make my own simple escaperoom-esque type of game, as well as learning RPGMaker XP and creating my own Pokemon fangame.
