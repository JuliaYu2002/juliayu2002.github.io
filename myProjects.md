# Projects

[Robot System Integration - Hexapod](https://github.com/smith-scram-lab/Mr.Krab), a special studies project over Spring 2024 which consisted of testing and evaluating Dynamixel servos used by a Hexapod, and analyzing and creating an easier way to interface and program said servos. I worked under Professor Kevin Huang at Smith College for this project.

[R Weather Package](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/weather), a package usable in RStudio made for *Programming for Data Science in R* with 2 others. Made Spring 2024. It enables the user to plot forcast weather data scraped from The Weather Channel for Northampton, MA as well as past weather data from another source. I specifically covered web scraping for the forcast data and cleaned it to be in a easier to read data frame.

[Misty Robot Investigation](https://github.com/SWorster/MistySURF2023), a repository of code usable with the robot Misty by Furhat Robotics created by myself and one other person over Summer 2023 as a research project for Professor Ileana Streinu. I focused on hardware and made a physical controller for Misty using an Arduino Nano and a Bluetooth module to connect to a computer which would send commands to the robot.

[Bootleg Pokemon](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/bootleg-pokemon), my final project for *Computer Graphics* taken Spring 2023. It utilizes Blender to make a player model and some models of Pokemon obtained online, ThreeJS for creating the actual scene and JavaScript for getting the game intricacies to work.

[Valetbike](https://github.com/csc223-cloaf/valetbike), a semester-long project for *Intro to Software Engineering* taken Spring 2022 made with 3 others. I focused on front end and styling of the site (which was posted to Heroku but has since been taken down due to the free plan no longer existing) while others focused on the back end which used Ruby on Rails.

[Machine Learning Models Investigation](https://github.com/comp-machine-learning-fall2022/portfolio-JuliaYu2002), the final portfolio for the *Computational Machine Learning* class held Fall 2022. This investigates hard coded methods on comparison with methods from a library in Python.

[Pokemon Classification Model](https://github.com/comp-machine-learning-fall2022/project-2-JuliaYu2002), the 2nd project for the class *Computational Machine Learning* during Fall 2022. This attempts to characterize what part of a Pokemon's stats would classify it as a "legend," "mythical," or "pseudo legend" Pokemon.

[PokeStats](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/PokeStats), created in Fall 2020 as my final project for Data Structures. A console-based data filtering program which uses 2 csv files and a Java file to narrow down Pokemon based on criteria specified by the user. Also has a textual type guessing game.

[Hackcation 2020 Project](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/TheGoodVibes), created in Summer 2020 with 3 others during a hackathon that spanned a weekend.

[Google CSSI Final Project](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/cssiFinal), created in Summer 2020 with a partner as a final project for a program I was a part of.

[Code from my dual enrollment at CUNY Hunter College](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/HunterDE), code that was from the 2019 - 2020 academic year which I spent taking college classes as a high school senior.
