# Who am I?

(That **is** a good question... Who am I in this world?)

I'm a New Yorker, born and raised. I recently graduated Smith College with a Bachelors in Computer Science (as my major) and I also minored in Engineering. I identify as a POC woman in STEM and my pronouns are she/her.

## Where I've Been (Education-wise)

As stated above, I attended Smith College (Northampton, MA) and graduated May 2024. I graduated high school in 2020 from Manhattan Hunter Science High School in NYC. I had the privilage of having dual enrollment with CUNY Hunter College during my senior year.

I will be attending Cornell Tech over the upcoming academic year to earn a MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

## What I Want to do

My dream job would allow me to create new technology, whether code or actual hardware, using my own hands to make an impact on the world. I also would like to make a video game; Stardew Valley is an inspiration to me.
