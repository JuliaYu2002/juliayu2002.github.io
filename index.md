# Hi! I'm Julia!

I'm passionate about learning and I'm looking for more opprotunities to broaden my horizons! I'll be attending Cornell Tech for a MEng in Electrical and Computer Engineering for the coming academic year.

### Interests

I like coding? I've gone with C++ for just under a year, and then I switched to Java and I have about a year in that. I also have experience in Python and JavaScript, but they aren't my first choice to code in.

I also like robots and the AI that moves robots autonomously. I have a small robot I built using Arduino from back when I was about 11.
