# Hi! I'm Julia!

I'm an 18 year old college sophomore, attending Smith College. I'm majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Engineering.

### Projects, I guess?

I took Data Structures last year, and my final project was called [PokeStats](https://github.com/JuliaYu2002/PokeStats).

I'm currently trying to work on learning PyGame and make my own simple escaperoom-esque type of game.

### My Interests?

I enjoy playing video games on my Switch very much, as well as my 3DS.
Games I like include:
- Pokemon as a whole
- Farming simulators such as Story of Seasons, Stardew Valley, and Rune Factory
- Splatoon 2
- Genshin Impact
- Monster Hunter Stories 2 Wings of Ruin
