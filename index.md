# Hi! I'm Julia!

I'm passionate about learning and I'm looking for more opprotunities to broaden my horizons!

### My Interests?

I enjoy playing video games on my Switch very much, as well as my 3DS.
Games I like include:
- Pokemon as a whole
- Farming simulators such as Story of Seasons, Stardew Valley, and Rune Factory
- Splatoon 2
- Genshin Impact
- Monster Hunter Stories 2 Wings of Ruin
- The Etrian Odyssey series

I like coding? I've gone with C++ for just under a year, and then I switched to Java and I have about a year in that. I also have experience in Python and JavaScript, but they aren't my first choice to code in.

I also like robots and the AI that moves robots autonomously. I have a small robot I built using Arduino from back when I was about 11.
