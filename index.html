                </a>
                <br>
                <p>Using Unity and an Oculus Quest 3, I created an AR experience that can interface with ROS controlled Dynamixel motors. The user can make sweeping gestures with their right hand and select motors with their left hand. The motors will move
                    in the direction of the gesture and stop when the user releases the gesture. I worked under Professor Harald Haraldsson in Cornell Tech's XR Collaboratory.</p>

                <br>
                <p>I examined a PhantomX Hexapod Mk-III robot to see if it was still operable. This used 18 daisy-chained Dyanmixel motors to move 6 legs. I created a Python script to move its legs to user-specified positions by adapting the Dynamixel SDK.
                    I worked under Professor Kevin Huang in Smith College's Scram Lab.

                <p>My final project for my computer graphics class. I utilized Blender to make a player model and to orient models of Pokemon obtained online, ThreeJS for creating the actual scene and JavaScript for getting the game intricacies to work.

            <h2>üë®‚Äçüíª About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate developer with an ideal in creating new technology, whether code or actual hardware, using my own hands to make an impact on the world.</p>
            <p>It began with click-and-drag code blocks in Scratch, to a robot project in a summer camp during middle school, to a dip into the ocean that is Unity, to robots in college, and now I'm here.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I'll be playing video games or drawing characters that float through my mindscape.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Current Focus: </strong>Learning about the game development pipeline and looking for my first job.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Philosophy: </strong>You might be free from academia, but you're never free from learning.</p>
