# Video Games

I mainly play on my Nintendo Switch and 3DS. Games such as Spatoon 3, Octopath Traveler 2, Pokemon, Etrian Odyssey and Fire Emblem hold my attention. I also play Honkai: Star Rail and Wuthering Waves on my iPad.

# Machining

I have CAD experience using SolidWorks and Fusion 360. I've also used a lathe to make a Stirling Engine for a class. I also have 3D printed a few parts for a robot I've worked with.

# Coding

I find it hard to learn spoken and written languages, so I'm interested in learning a lot of different coding languages so I can say that I'm an omniglot (this is a joke, but I'm serious about wanting to learn a lot of coding languages).
