The point of the game:
It's basically a simplified Pokemon battle simulator which cuts a lot of the main aspects about battle to make this a feasible ~2 week project.
It has an exploration aspect with "random" encounters like in the games before Gen 8,
there is only 1 move for each Pokemon which does set damage,
and their stats are very static (no level up system).

It's technically an otherwise endless game.

How to move:
You can use the arrow keys to move while in the scene you first load into.
That scene is the exploration scene.

How to battle:
Press A while in a battle to advance through the fight where each Pokemon hits the other with their move.
Pressing F will cause you to flee the battle.
After a fight is won, lost, or fled from, you can continue exploring by pressing Y, or stop playing entirely and see your win/loss/flee ratio with N.
If N is pressed and you want to play again, you need to reload the page.

Future Additions:
- Making side bounds so you can't walk off the screen
- Implementing a level up system
- Implementing a bag with prizes for winning fights
- Add an endgame
- Make it more randomized?
- Make it so you don't have to reload the page to play again
