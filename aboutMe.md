# Who am I?

(That **is** a good question... Who am I in this world?)

To start with, I'm an 18 year old college student. I attend Smith College as a rising Sophomore, and I'm firm in my belief that I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Engineering.

### Where I've Been (Education-wise)

As stated above, yep. I attend Smith College, located in Northampton, MA. I graduated high school in 2020 from Manhattan Hunter Science High School in NYC. I had the privilage of having dual enrollment with CUNY Hunter College during my senior year, which was why I was able to skip straight to Data Structures my first semester at Smith.
