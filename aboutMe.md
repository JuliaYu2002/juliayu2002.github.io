# Who am I?

(That **is** a good question... Who am I in this world?)

I'm a New Yorker, born and raised. I recently graduated Smith College with a Bachelors in Computer Science (as my major) and I also minored in Engineering. I identify as a POC woman in STEM and my pronouns are she/her.

### Where I've Been (Education-wise)

As stated above, I attended Smith College (Northampton, MA). I graduated high school in 2020 from Manhattan Hunter Science High School in NYC. I had the privilage of having dual enrollment with CUNY Hunter College during my senior year, which was why I was able to skip straight to Data Structures my first semester at Smith.
